Running Tests
There are 2 ways to run the tests inside the container.

The volume must be shared both ways.  The first is to just run the main
container and then attach to it and run the npm run test in the main
container.
`docker run -it 35528d14a1a1 npm run test`

The other way is to start up a separate container using docker compose,
and then attach to the secondary container.

You can't attach stdout to npm run test either way, because it spawns
a subprocess, and docker only lets you attach to the main process.
